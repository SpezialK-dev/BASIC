# What is this about?

this is a uni project where I wrote a version of BASIC. 

Due to time limitations when creating this I will only have a shortend version of basic I will not have every comand included this version might not even be Turing complete. 
I might stray away from other BASIC implementations, so it would be more fair to call this a BASIC like language. 
My goal with this is to optimize the language as much as possible. 

Currently the DOCS are only available in german, since referencing them in the future might be handy, but I might if I find the time translate them afterwards into english otherwiese.

Design inspirations have been drawn from ATARI BASIC. Since there is a very good book out there. 

The Roadmap is as follows :
